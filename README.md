# My First Neural Network
 This is my journey of implementing my first ANN (artificial neural network), specifically a multi-layer perceptron, in Python, from scratch (no ML library). Currently, this represents an annotated study/implementation of the great Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd engine! More to come.

## NOTICE
If you attempt to preview the jupyter project and you find that the preview is stuttering rapidly, decreasing the zoom of your browser (ex. 100% to 80%) may solve the issue.
