# My First Neural Network
 This is my journey of implementing my first ANN (artificial neural network), specifically a multi-layer perceptron, in Python, from scratch (no ML library). Currently, this represents an annotated study/implementation of the great Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd engine! More to come.
